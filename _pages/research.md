## Working Papers

My dissertation focused on the economic implications and impacts of dollar store expansion in the U.S. food retail market. Since the early 2000s, dollar stores have increasingly diversified their food product offerings. Advocates and policymakers assert that dollar stores target low-income, under-served communities and negatively affect the local economy and consumer health by driving the exit of conventional grocery stores and by selling less nutritious food. Numerous city councils across the United States have imposed restrictions on dollar store entry, including bans on new locations, to promote the establishment of healthy food stores. My research studies the growth of dollar stores across the United States over a twenty-year period from 2000 to 2020, and investigates their impacts on household food access and retail competition. Using NielsenIQ TDLinx retail store location data from 2000 to 2020, I plot the share of census tract households whose nearest retail food store is a dollar store.
