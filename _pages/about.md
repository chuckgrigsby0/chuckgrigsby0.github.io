I am a research agricultural economist at the USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS). I have expertise in food systems, food retail markets, the food environment, community economic development, and socioeconomic inequality. I am interested in combining frameworks from economic theory with novel data, machine learning, and causal inference techniques to address complex research questions in the context of changing food systems.  

My dissertation investigated the economic impacts and implications of the expansion of dollar stores across the United States. I employed machine learning (ML) models to study dollar store growth from 2000 to 2020, leveraging their data-driven approach and predictive accuracy to understand dollar store location strategies. I also used an ML imputation method to investigate the causal effects of dollar store entry on household food access and on competition with small grocery stores and supermarkets, respectively. My research has broad applications in causal analysis, economic development, inequality, and sustainable food systems. 

This website contains information about my previous and ongoing research.

My dissertation focused on the economic implications and impacts of dollar store expansion in the U.S. food retail market. Since the early 2000s, dollar stores have increasingly diversified their food product offerings. Advocates and policymakers assert that dollar stores target low-income, under-served communities and negatively affect the local economy and consumer health by driving the exit of conventional grocery stores and by selling less nutritious food. Numerous city councils across the United States have imposed restrictions on dollar store entry, including bans on new locations, to promote the establishment of healthy food stores. My research studies the growth of dollar stores across the United States over a twenty-year period from 2000 to 2020, and investigates their impacts on household food access and retail competition. 

To better understand their growth over space and time, I plot the share of census-tract households whose nearest retail food store is a dollar store using NielsenIQ TDLinx retail store location data from 2000 to 2020. Dollar stores have particularly grown in the Northeast and West regions relative to their store presence in the early 2000s. However, a larger share of census-tract households' nearest store is a dollar store in the South and Midwest, the regions in which the dollar store format originated.

My research of dollar stores relates to food retail markets, the food environment, community economic development, and socioeconomic inequality. Below are two of my working papers from this research that assess the dynamic growth patterns of dollar stores from 2000 to 2020 and the impact of dollar store entry on block-group household food access.
